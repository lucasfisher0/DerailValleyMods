<!-- PROJECT TITLE -->
<div align="center">
	<h1>Derail Valley Mods</h1>
</div>

Mods for Derail Valley, intended for use through the [Unity Mod Manager][umm-url].


### Fast Travel Model Name

Adds the model name of a locomotive to the fast travel prompt. This is achieved by clicking on a locomotive (yellow triangle) from the world map.

### My Summer Train

WIP.

### Enable Unity Explorer

Based off [bdlm-dev's mod](dredge-mods-url) of the same type. Loads Unity Explorer through a method compatible with Unity Mod Manager, allowing easy use in Derail Valley. This also uses [bdlm-dev's fork of Unity Explorer](ue-fork-url), compiled using HarmonyLib instead of HarmonyX.

This currently needs a patch to fix mouse input, as currently no mouse interactions are functional.
